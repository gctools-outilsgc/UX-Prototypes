Ive got 2 versions of Wiki Page main graphic device: One set with Arial, no edit to icon, 2nd set with DS fonts (Rubik (H1) & Nunito Sans (paragraph)) with a major edit to the Icon (extended network bar)
This is done to give you a choice, maybe if you wanted to pilot some DS stuff in the live sites.
Please use whatever you see fit, or in case someone doesn't like whats placed, you have alternates to Swap in (???)
