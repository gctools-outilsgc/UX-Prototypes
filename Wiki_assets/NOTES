Ive got 2 versions of Wiki Page main graphic device: One set with Arial, no edit to icon, 2nd set with DS fonts (Rubik (H1) & Nunito Sans (paragraph)) with a major edit to the Icon (extended network bar)
This is done to give you a choice, maybe if you wanted to pilot some DS stuff in the live sites
